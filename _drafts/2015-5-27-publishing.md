title : Publishing culture: data mining vs. natural sciences

{% include JB/setup %}

I've seen publishing in data mining and in natural sciences. Actually, I am part of the process an author, reviewer and editor. There are some differences between data mining (DM) publishing habits and natural sciences (NS), and I like and dislike bits from both. Mostly dislike. 

1. In DM main publihshing is in conference proceedings, in NS - in journals. Conference reviewing is considered to be faster, but that is because journal reviewing in DM is so slow. 3 months for a journal review would be considered very fast in DM, but quite long in NS. This is because NS papers typically follow very standard structure (intro, materials and methods, results, discussion), and, arguably, easier to review: is the methodology ok, are the conclusions ok?

2. Typically, NS papers have many more co-authors than DM. In medicine all the lab may become co-authors. In many NS publications people who share data become co-authors, even if this data has already been published. I have heard stories that museum curators become co-authors for allowing to access collections. I think sharing data is not enough to become a co-author. 

3. In NS responsibilities of the co-authors are much more divided. In DM typcially everybody works on everything alltogether. 

4. NS takes more pride in their text. Text is important. In DM figures and visuals are important. 

I like journals more because often there is a chance to revise and resubmit. 

As a disclaimer, all this is a personal opinion about general trends. Counterexamples can always be found.
