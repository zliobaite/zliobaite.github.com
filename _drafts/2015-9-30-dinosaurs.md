Actually, nothing. But we are computing a lot about fossils. We actaually model climate from animal teeth. 

For about a year now I have been working with paleontolgists, researchers who study fossils.

Typically, the best preserved parts in fossils are teeth. Teeth also have very complex patterns, as compared to, for example, bones. And these patterns evolutionary depend on what kind of food animals have been eating. And food availability depends on the climate. So teeth can serve as currency for converting climate conditions now to millions of years back.
