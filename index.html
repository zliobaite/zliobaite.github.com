<h3>Welcome</h3>

<br>

My name is Indr&#279; &#381;liobait&#279;. 
I am a research scientist in data analysis. 
I started this blog to experiment with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/"> Jekyll </a>. 
I'm posting bits and pieces related to data science that I do. <br>

Lately, the blog focuses on fairness in machine learning and data mining.
We study how to make predictive models free from discrimination, 
when historical data, on which they are built, may be biased, incomplete, 
or even contain past discriminatory decisions. <br>

See my <a href="http:www.zliobaite.com"> website </a> for more info about my research. <br>
